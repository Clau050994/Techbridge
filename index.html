    <h2 class="heading flex-item">What is TechBridge</h2>
    <p class="paragraphmodifier flex-item">TechBridge is a platform designed to address the growing issue of electronic waste and
        the digital divide. In today's fast-paced world, electronic devices become obsolete quickly, leading to a
        substantial increase in electronic waste. Simultaneously, many individuals and communities lack access to these
        devices due to financial constraints. TechBridge bridges this gap by providing a user-friendly website where people
        can donate their unused electronic devices, helping to reduce electronic waste and make technology more accessible
        to those in need. This initiative not only promotes environmental sustainability but also fosters a sense of
        community and goodwill among its users by encouraging the sharing of electronics for a greater social impact.

    <h3 class="intresting">Environmental Impact:</h3>
    <p class="paragraphmodifier">The rapid obsolescence of electronic devices leads to a significant accumulation of
        electronic waste, which often contains hazardous materials. Improper disposal can result in soil and water
        pollution, posing long-term environmental threats. The improper handling of electronic waste can have lasting
        effects on ecosystems and public health.

    <h3 class="intresting">Education and Opportunity Gap:</h3>
    <p class="paragraphmodifier">In communities where access to electronic devices is limited, a digital divide hinders
        educational and economic progress, perpetuating inequality. Bridging this gap is essential for a more equitable
        society. Sharing devices within the community allows those who no longer need them to empower others, ensuring
        access to technology becomes a shared resource for equal opportunities.

    <p class="paragraphmodifier">This article talks about electronic waste, or e-waste, poses and the significant
        environmental and health concern. Despite accounting for a small fraction of total waste, it contributes the
        majority of heavy metals in landfills. To combat this issue, it is crucial to responsibly dispose of old
        electronic devices. One effective approach is to prioritize reuseâ€”selling or donating functioning devices to
        organizations and programs that can put them to good use. When recycling is necessary, seek out local e-waste
        recycling centers or take advantage of retailer programs. Furthermore, extending the lifespan of electronics
        through proper maintenance and protection is key to reducing e-waste. By taking these steps, individuals can play
        a vital role in mitigating the harmful effects of e-waste and preserving our planet for future generations.

    <a class="heading" href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/59-million-tons-our-e-waste-problem-getting-out-control/">At 59 Million Tons, Our E-Waste Problem Is Getting Out of Control</a>
    <p class="paragraphmodifier">The article highlights the growing issue of electronic waste (e-waste) generated by the
        rapid turnover of electronic devices. Despite the devices getting smaller and lighter, people discard and upgrade
        them frequently, resulting in a significant increase in e-waste production. E-waste contains toxic chemicals and
        metals that pose risks to the environment and health when not recycled properly. The Global E-waste Monitor
        predicts that e-waste will nearly double to 74 metric tons by 2030. It also emphasizes the potential economic value of
        recycling e-waste, including precious metals. The lack of e-waste legislation in many countries has led to
        dangerous recycling practices, often involving children. The article calls for more responsible e-waste legislation and
        recycling practices, as well as pressure on tech companies to reduce planned obsolescence. It emphasizes the need
        for individuals to consider their choices regarding new electronics and the impact on the environment.
