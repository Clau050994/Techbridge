    <h2 class="heading flex-item">What is TechBridge</h2>
    <p class="paragraphmodifier flex-item">TechBridge is a platform designed to address the growing issue of electronic waste and
        the digital divide. In today's fast-paced world, electronic devices become obsolete quickly, leading to a
        substantial increase in electronic waste. Simultaneously, many individuals and communities lack access to these
        devices due to financial constraints. TechBridge bridges this gap by providing a user-friendly website where people
        can donate their unused electronic devices, helping to reduce electronic waste and make technology more accessible
        to those in need. This initiative not only promotes environmental sustainability but also fosters a sense of
        community and goodwill among its users by encouraging the sharing of electronics for a greater social impact.

           <p class="paragraphmodifier">In communities where access to electronic devices is limited, a digital divide hinders educational and economic progress, perpetuating inequality. Bridging this gap is essential for a more equitable society. Sharing devices within the community allows those who no longer need them to empower others, ensuring access to technology becomes a shared resource for equal opportunities.</p>
