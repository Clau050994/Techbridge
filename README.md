## Description
In the digital era, possessing a device transcends luxuryâ€”it's often a necessity. Yet, not everyone is in a position to own one. **TechBridge** is an initiative where those in need can narrate their stories, illustrating their device requirements. Donors, inspired by these stories, can then step in to make a pivotal difference.

## Features
- **User Profiles:** Individuals can craft profiles to portray their stories.
- **Story Feed:** An active feed featuring the narratives of people in need of devices.
- **Direct Contact:** Donors can effortlessly connect with the individual they resonate with.
- **Donor Feedback:** Post-donation, donors can detail their experience, ensuring transparency and building community trust.
- **Donation Completion:** Donors can mark donations as completed, aiding in keeping track of fulfilled commitments.
- **Dark Mode:** A visual alternative for users who favor darker themes.
- **Signature Petitions:** Empower causes by endorsing online petitions.
